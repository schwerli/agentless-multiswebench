Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
pytest --collect-only needs a one char shortcut command
I find myself needing to run `--collect-only` very often and that cli argument is a very long to type one. 

I do think that it would be great to allocate a character for it, not sure which one yet. Please use up/down thumbs to vote if you would find it useful or not and eventually proposing which char should be used. 

Clearly this is a change very easy to implement but first I want to see if others would find it useful or not.
