Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
method = builtin_str(method) problem
In requests/sessions.py is a command:

method = builtin_str(method)
Converts method from
b’GET’
to
"b'GET’"

Which is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method "b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.

I am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this "args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.

I'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.

Also, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.
