### GitHub Problem Description ###
Flask routes to return domain/sub-domains information
Currently when checking **flask routes** it provides all routes but **it is no way to see which routes are assigned to which subdomain**.

**Default server name:**
SERVER_NAME: 'test.local'

**Domains (sub-domains):**
test.test.local
admin.test.local
test.local

**Adding blueprints:**
app.register_blueprint(admin_blueprint,url_prefix='',subdomain='admin')
app.register_blueprint(test_subdomain_blueprint,url_prefix='',subdomain='test')


```
$ flask routes
 * Tip: There are .env or .flaskenv files present. Do "pip install python-dotenv" to use them.
Endpoint                                                 Methods    Rule
-------------------------------------------------------  ---------  ------------------------------------------------
admin_blueprint.home                                      GET        /home
test_subdomain_blueprint.home                             GET        /home
static                                                    GET        /static/<path:filename>
...
```


**Feature request**
It will be good to see something like below (that will make more clear which route for which subdomain, because now need to go and check configuration).
**If it is not possible to fix routes**, can you add or tell which method(s) should be used to get below information from flask? 

```
