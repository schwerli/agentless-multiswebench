Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot
This is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested. An error was already added for endpoint names in 1.0, but should have been added for this as well.
